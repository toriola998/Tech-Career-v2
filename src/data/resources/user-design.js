        `A common misconception people have is that when they hear the term
        “Design”, they immediately assume you are talking about graphics
        design. But the fact is that design extends beyond just graphics
        design and another important aspect of design in software
        development is UI/UX design`,

        `Although the term UI and UX design are often used synonymously, they
        are technically not the same thing at all. UI design means User
        Interface design while UX design means User Experience design`,

        `UI or User Interface design is the aspect of design that focuses on
        the graphical layout of a mobile app, website or software. UI design
        is mainly focused on how the user navigates a software product. This
        includes aspects of a software like the buttons, text entry field
        and any other item the users will interact with while using the
        product.`,

        `UI design involves designing screen layouts, interface animations,
        transitions and any other micro interactions. Basically, they decide
        what the product will look like. The focus on the aesthetics like
        the button shapes, color scheme, fonts, animation and any other type
        of visual element.`,

        `UI designers are considered graphic designers since they are
        concerned with aesthetics and they are responsible for making sure
        the theme of a software properly embodies its personality and
        visually stimulates the users.`

        `UX design is User Experience design, it is the process of creating
        the best experience for users as they interact with the software
        product. It involves studying users and their behaviors and plans
        their experience on the app. It also deals with helping the users
        achieve their tasks on the app as fast as possible.`,
        
        `Basically, user experience depends on the ease with which users
        interact with the user interface. This is why user Interface design
        is an important aspect of User experience design. However, while UI
        design is concerned with the visual element of a software tool, UX
        design decides how the UI works.`,
