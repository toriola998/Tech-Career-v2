        `One of the greatest technological advancements of the last decade is
        Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a sub-field of Artificial
        Intelligence that is defined as computer systems that can mimic
        human behaviour. Machine Learning is the development of computer
        systems that can learn by analysing the data provided. In other
        words, it simply means providing programs with the ability to learn
        without being programmed explicitly.`,

        `Machine Learning Engineers are responsible for creating algorithms
        that can detect patterns by themselves without being explicitly
        programmed. The aim of this is to allow systems to learn without
        human aid and then perform actions accordingly. Machine learning
        systems search for patterns in data and make improved decisions on
        future instances.`,

        `Machine Learning is used to develop AI systems like chat bots,
        language translation applications, and predictive text. It is also
        used to develop recommender systems like the ones that recommend
        products, feeds, and shows for you on Amazon, social media, and
        Netflix respectively.`,

        `Advanced Machine Learning models are also used to develop systems in
        autonomous vehicles and machines like assisted surgery robots and
        machines that are used to diagnose medical conditions with images.`
