        of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT
        operations (Ops) in order to reduce the development cycle of
        software systems while providing speedy delivery with high-quality
        software products`,

        `DevOps combines disciplines, tools, cultural philosophies, and
        practices to help companies deliver software products and scale at
        high velocity. The main aim of DevOps is to optimize the speed at
        which software developers build, test, deliver and iterate software
        products.`,

        `Using the DevOps model means that development and operation teams
        are no longer operating separately, instead, they merge and work
        closely together across all the software development cycles from
        development to deployment and operations.`
