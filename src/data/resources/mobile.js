        `Research has shown that over 70% of web traffic is generated by
        mobile devices, so it only makes sense for software developers to
        develop mobile applications specifically for these devices. And
        that is exactly what Mobile development is. Mobile development is
        simply the branch of software development that deals with
        developing software for mobile devices like smart phones or
        tablets.`,

        `As it stands now, the fact remains that research shows that
        adults spend an average of 3+ hours on their mobile devices daily
        browsing the web. This is why mobile applications are considered
        the future of businesses all around the world. The most popular
        e-commerce platforms like Amazon have already started making use
        of mobile applications for their business development.`,

        `Mobile development often involves a series of design and
        programming processes aimed at creating the best application from
        scratch in the shortest possible time.`,
