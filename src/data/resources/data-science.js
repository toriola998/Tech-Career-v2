        `Data Science is an integration of multiple disciplines, including
        statistics, software development, and business, to derive essential
        insights from data by carrying out controlled analysis on the data.
        Basically, the aim of any data science project is to derive
        actionable insights for the business from which the data was
        generated. This will help the business make improved business
        decisions`,

        `Data science enables businesses to figure out patterns in large
        amounts of unstructured and structured datasets. This, in turn,
        helps businesses enhance efficiency, identify potential business
        opportunities, improve market advantage, and optimize costs.`,

        `Data Science can be found at the center of Personal assistants like
        Cortana, Siri, and Alexa. Machine learning is one of the
        specializations of Data science, and it is also at the core of
        autonomous self-driving cars, chatbots, assisted surgery robots,
        recommender systems in Netflix and Amazon, Health recognition
        machines, and spam detection algorithms in Gmail.`,

        `Data Science often involves mining huge amounts of raw data, both
        unstructured and structured, to find patterns and get useful
        insights from them. It is an interdisciplinary field with a basis in
        fields like computer science, machine learning algorithm
        development, inference, predictive analysis, and statistics.`
