        `Commonly referred to as Client-Side Development, Front-End
        Development is the software development aspect responsible for
        designing the client-side interface of the software, website,
        or application. Basically, front-end developers are
        responsible for developing everything a user sees and
        interacts with on the software. Their role is to turn the code
        written by back-end developers into an interactive graphical
        interface that will present information in a user-friendly
        format.`,

        `Developing software without a front end will result in a site
        or app with just codes that users with no programming
        background cannot understand. So basically, the role of
        front-end development is to help develop an interface that
        will allow users to easily interact with the back-end of a
        website, software, or application.`,

        `However, there are factors that a front-end needs to consider
        in order to be able to design an efficient front-end. The
        first one is the varying devices that often come in different
        screen sizes and resolutions, thus making the developer
        consider this during development.`,

        `The other factors include varying browser types and operating
        systems. This means that a front-end developer has to ensure
        the website, app or software is cross-browser, cross-OS, and
        cross-device.`
