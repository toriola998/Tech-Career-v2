        `While front-end development is the development of the user interface
        (visuals and graphics), backend development is the aspect of web
        development responsible for developing the logic behind the site's
        front-end component. Basically, it is in charge of the
        behind-the-scenes activities of the website that occur when a user
        performs an action on the website.`,

        `Backend development is the development of the server-side of a
        website. It is responsible for APIs, databases, servers, and backend
        logic.`,

        `The backend of a website is often developed by seamlessly
        integrating applications, databases, and servers. Backend developers
        create codes that aid the browser in interacting with the databases
        (storing data in the database, modifying the data, reading the data,
        or erasing the data from the database).`,

        `For instance, after filling a form on a website and submitting it,
        the data you provided will be transferred to the server, which
        processes it and then sends it to the database for storage.`
